# Vital Sensing with Radar and ML (Hackathon)

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/ifx-eestec-hack/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/ifx-eestec-hack/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

## Getting Started

**TL;DR:** This quick guide explains how to aquire data from the Infineon radar board with Python.

Please start by installing the most recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). We also recommend to install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) for running the examples. Afterwards you can clone this git repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Infineon/hackathon
cd hackathon
```

Now you can install the required Python package for the data acquisition with Pip:
```
pip install ifxdaq-3.0.1-py3-none-xxx.whl
```

:information_source: Make sure to replace _xxx_ by the correct filename according to your operating system and system architecture (see *.whl files in the repo for possible options).

**Now your system is ready to aquire radar data!**

Since some processing steps are recommended for the radar data you should install the following dependencies:

```
pip install numpy
pip install lsq-ellipse circle_fit
```

**For further information please check the ifxdaq documentation.** To access to documentation navigate in the cloned repository to the folder `docs` and open the file `index.html` with a web browser.
